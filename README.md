### Google Data Analystics Professional Certificate: Cyclistic Case Study
**Description:**
*(This case study is for Google Data Analysis Professional Certificate)* 

Cyclistic is a bike-share company that features more than 5,800 bicycles in 692 stations across Chicago. The director of marketing believes Cyclisticâ€™s future depends on maximising the number of annual memberships. To achieve this vision, the marketing analytics team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use the programme differently & to design a new marketing programme as a recommendation to convert casual riders into annual members. Thereafter, the Cyclistic executives will determine whether to approve the recommended marketing programme. 

**Objective:** To identify the differences between casual riders and members in order to design a new marking programme to convert casual riders into annual members.
